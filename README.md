Requirements
============

The Opscode 'chef_handler' cookbook to allow the handler to be dynamically installed without modifying the client configuration

Attributes
==========

node[:minitest][:path] - Location to store and find tests

Usage
=====

* The node run list should begin with 'recipe[chef_handler], recipe[chef-minitest]'
* Each cookbook should contain tests in the 'tests/minitest/<recipe_name>' directory with a file suffix of '_test.rb'

Minitest: https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest

Example
=====

    class TestApache2 < MiniTest::Chef::TestCase
      def test_that_the_package_installed
        case node[:platform]
        when "ubuntu","debian"
          assert system('apt-cache policy apache2 | grep Installed | grep -v none')
        end
      end
    
      def test_that_the_service_is_running
        assert system('/etc/init.d/apache2 status')
      end
    
      def test_that_the_service_is_enabled
        assert File.exists?(Dir.glob("/etc/rc5.d/S*apache2").first)
